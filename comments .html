        <p>The Gothic style emerged around 1140 in Île-de-France and   
           <br> subsequently spread throughout Europe. <br> Gothic churches lost the compact qualities of the Romanesque era,<br> and decorations often contained symbolic and allegorical features. <br> The first pointed arches, rib vaults, and buttresses began to appear, <br> all possessing geometric properties that reduced the need for large, <br> rigid walls to ensure structural stability. <br> This also permitted the size of windows to increase, producing brighter and lighter interiors. <br> Nave ceilings rose, and pillars and steeples heightened. Many architects <br> used these developments to push the limits of structural possibility, an inclination that resulted in the collapse of <br> several towers possessing designs that had unwittingly exceeded the boundaries of soundness. <br> In Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain, it became popular to build hall churches, <br> a style in which every vault would be built to the same height.

            Gothic cathedrals were lavishly designed, <br> as in the romanesque era, and many <br> share romanesque traits. However, several also exhibit unprecedented degrees of <br> detail and complexity in decoration. <br> The Notre-Dame de Paris and Notre-Dame de Reims in France, as well as the San Francesco <br> Assisi in Palermo, and the Salisbury Cathedral and Wool <br> Church in England and Santhome Church in Chennai,<br> India shows the elaborate stylings characteristic of Gothic cathedrals.
            
            Some of the most well-known gothic <br> churches remained unfinished for centuries,<br> after the gothic style fell out of popularity. One such example is the construction of the Cologne Cathedral, which began in 1248, halted in 1473, and not resumed until 1842.</p></dd>
